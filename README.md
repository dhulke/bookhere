# Material UI - Vite.js example

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Concept

This is a very simple booking application where you can insert, edit and remove properties and book several date ranges in each property. The booking algorithm will make sure overlaps aren't allowed.

## Todo

Although a simple task, this took me a couple of hours and so I decided to cut down on a few features so as to not spend too many hours on this initial challenge. A few more things I would have liked to add are:

* Testing with Playwright
* Use the free react-dates component by airbnb
* Image upload
* Image slider
